                                        Of all the products I have ever purchased, this is probably the one that had the most expectations riding on it. My legs were covered with ingrowns and everything I had tried didn't work. I was very miserable with my legs and covered it always. Tend Skin
                                        was a last-ditch attempt, the only hope I had left. The reviews raised my expectations but after 3 years of trying things and not getting anything close to what I wanted (clear legs), I was also afraid. The first
                                        one month I wasn't sure if it working. I paired this with the Tend Skin shave gel (another great product) and religiously used it daily/after every shave. The results slowly materialized. Within 4 months, 90% of
                                        the ingrowns had disappeared (my legs looked so different!). After 6 months of continuous use, only one was left. I probably started with a 100 at least. So thank you Tend Skin! You are one of the few products I
                                        can't live without. You have made me like my legs again. You have removed my daily worries/sadness regarding how it looks. Everyone who is plagued by ingrowns, please give this product a try! I can almost promise
                                        it won't disappoint you (my legs were Horrendous and it worked on them). Just be patient with it and pair it with the shave gel and use it exactly like stated. Good luck!

                                        My wife recommended this product and I remember I had used it years ago and liked it. Now that I also shave my head, it is something I can't do without. As an African-American keeping a close shave can be a challenge when the hair starts to grow back.
                                        This product is essential for me to prevent hair bumps, razor burn and unsightly skin discoloration. I use a splash on my face and scalp on the days I shave and in between just to keep the skin "treated". It does
                                        have a little sting so its better to apply once you skin is drier or dry. I don't mind the sting personally as the results are well worth the momentary "wake-up" call. :-) I use both a multi-blade Schick Hydro 5
                                        for the initial shave and a wet/dry electric razor for daily upkeep. This way I only have to use the safety razor once a week. Proper shaving technique is a must, but Tend Skin has prevented any unsightly bumps,
                                        ingrown hairs and irritating razor burn so its well worth the costs. I also squirt some in a small travel bottle so I have some with be if I feel a little itch here and there as the hair starts to grow back in.
                                        Don't scratch, just dab some Tend Skin on it.

                                        I've had these pimple like sores on my scalp that appear out of no where and don't seem to heal very fast (weeks). I've tried all kinds of remedies that people have suggested from shampoos, to ointments, to tea tree oils, dandruff remedies, etc. I went
                                        to a dermatologist and he said, "you don't have any skin diseases." So much for the experts. My family physician prescribed me a potent anti-bacterial ointment that had some affect. Otherwise, nothing ever seemed
                                        to work. I asked my barber about it and he suggested Tend Skin. It's the only thing that has had any impact. The sores still come and go, but they "go" much faster when I use Tend Skin, plus I now have fewer sores.
                                        This stuff is great.
